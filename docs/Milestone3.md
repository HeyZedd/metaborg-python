# Milestone 3

In the third milestone the focus was mainly on increasing the coverage of the
language. It was expected that development on the Webassembly backend would be
slow, therefore it was deemed very likely that the code analysis would achieve
a higher coverage. In the following sections our progress is explained for the
three main areas of the code.

## Syntax/Desugaring

## Analysis

## Codegen
