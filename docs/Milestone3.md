# Milestone 3

In the third milestone the focus was mainly on increasing the coverage of the
language. It was expected that development on the Webassembly backend would be
slow, therefore it was deemed very likely that the code analysis would achieve
a higher coverage. In the following sections our progress is explained for the
three main areas of the code.

## Syntax/Desugaring

## Analysis

## Codegen

The goal for the code generation in the third milestone was to enable printing
of both strings and integers, and increasing the possibilities for function
calls, such that mathematical functions such as factorial could be calculated
and performed. This goal was split into four sections,

* Functions and function calls
* Printing Integers
* Being able to determine the type of an expression and perform the correct
  string conversion
* Add strings to strings or integers to strings
